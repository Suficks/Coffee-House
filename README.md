# Project Link [CoffeeHouse](https://house-of-coffee.netlify.app/)

## This is a website option for a coffee shop. It provides information about the coffee shop itself, its assortment, prices, location and contact information.

## This is my first website written with React. I am absolutely delighted with this technology and eager to continue learning it!

### Used technologies: 

- React, React-Router, React Hooks
